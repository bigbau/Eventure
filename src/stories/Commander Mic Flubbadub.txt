Commander Mic Flubbadub

On a blue sea near the island of Nots. Mic wore his pajamas with spots. Mic sailed on his boat that Mic named Miss Mandy. Mic drank fizzies with straws made of candy. Mic saw a tiny ship sail. Mic was surprised. It was maybe no bigger than a baby quirrel's tail. Mic slowed down his boat to get a closer peek and that's when Mic heard the funniest squeak. Somebody tiny down there on the deck was singing a song speck. Mic could barely hear what the little speck sang. So Mic leaned even closer and the tiny voice rang. The entity introduced itself as a little sailor from the sea and has a seahorse and a tail colored three. The sailor said that he is happy to have escaped from a clam. The sailor said that he is a brave little soldier. Mic was delighted to find them and wondered how many miles had travelled behind them. Mic asked the sailor where he is going. The sailor was startled. The sailor said that he still has a long way to go. The sailor said that it would take years and months to reach their destination. Mic said he could get the sailor to the destination faster. Mic picked up the boat and placed it in his shoulder. Mic sailed a few hours and reached the destination. The group of sailors rejoiced. The sailor gave their boat to Mic as a gift. Mic sails with their boat on his hat.
