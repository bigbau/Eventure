The Flying Zucchinis of Bim-Scatter-Ba-Raid

Out in the forest of Bim, the Zucchini brothers grew up in the trees where they played. They would swing from vines from the tallest of trees. They would fly through the  air with greatest of ease. The children would come from miles around to watch the Zuchini's flip without touching the ground. For years they did all their tricks for free until a man from the circus dropped in to see. He was convinced that the Zucchinis were great and could earn him big money he'd collect at the gate. They all dressed in green and went to the tent and dazzled the crowds for the money they spent. But one night at the show, a child could not pay and he sat outside of the tent the whole day. Then Bernie saw the kid and asked why does this one sit outside. The man at the gate got very upset for if this child could not pay then he would have to get. Then Beanie looked at the lad and said that it doesn't seem fair and the kid is looking so sad. The kid said that he used to watch them swing in the trees but now he can't watch them on the trapeze. Bartie tried to explain just why it was that they had changed. Bartie said that they need to get jobs to buy houses and cheese and small hats for their tiny pet mouses. Bartie proposed that the kid join them to swing since the kid doesn't have money. The kid scrambled inside and dressed in all green. When compared to the others, the kid was looking quite lean. Since the kid didn't know what to do, he rode on their shoulders and cheered. The Zucchinis threw the kid around like a football. The Zucchinis spun him in circles repeatedly. The crowd cheered for the kid as he climbed in the cannon. Good thing for the kid, there was a soft place to land in.
