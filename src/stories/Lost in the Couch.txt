On Sarah Drive near Parker and Clive, there stands a house that has been there since 1955. In the middle of the home sitting there all alone is the puffiest couch that was ever sown. When people come to check out the house, they always have a seat on the couch. They can never escape the puffy pillows. After a while, the pillows no longer feel stuffy. There's the Turstons from Texas and the Kipers from Melloy. Kipers twin boys, Frank and Fred has pepper-gun toys. There's Miss McFlurry who was in such a hurry, the way she was stuck was a little blurry. There's a cat named, Long-Tail, who is white and black. A policeman named Jack says that he has to get back. The painter who came to paint the house is named Mike. He was able to bring his bike inside the house. Peter and Paul look for coins on the floor but, after so many years, they can't find anymore. The baker bakes pies made out of the stuffing and belive it or not, they taste good. There's Zarsur and a Markle bean and a thing that can scream. There are Miff-Mitts and apricot pits and bowls of ice cream. There's a tank full of worms that are all gooey and sticky. There's an annoying young mule that's all angry and kicky. No one can ever leave the couch. Even though they wished at least Mister Grouch could crawl out the top and go back to his pad. Maybe he needs to spend more time with his Dad. Then all of a sudden, a strange package came down and made a noise like a clock winding down. The baker shouted that everyone better duck for the package would explode and would hit like a truck. When the dust was all gone, everything was fine. They all stood in the couch and waited in line for the baker made cookies that were jasper and clear. If you ever need to find them, they are still here. If someone ever wants to chat should call on the phone and don't sit on the couch unless you want to join their strange home. Don't call us on Sundays because that's when they sing. They don't answer the phone and just let it ring.
