Miss Mandy's Candy

Miss Mandy is handy at making fine candy from all over the world finds it dandy. They want to know her secret to everything yummy but she never tells them. She just rubs her tummy. People ask her if it was sugar or cinnamon or spice but she just denied with a smile. People ask her if it was oatmeal or flour or rice but again, she denied. She gave them advice to be happy they can have sweets that don't taste like cardboard or liverwurst beets or make them grow hair on the bottom of their feet. She said she can make anything taste better than when it started out. The fruitcake that she makes won't make anyone pout. SHe can make vegetables taste just like honey and her blueberry syrup is never too runny. At Thanksgiving time, she use her pumpkin pie ovens to make perfect pies. That's what she calls loving. At Christmas time she make cookies by the ton and wrap them in edible paper for fun. She sent forty cakes to the Bogglesworth house to feed Billy's family and his pet mouse. She sent marmalade to the Queen in the Castle. Who can make it herself but it's really a hassle. She sent pet shops pet food that pets really like, like strawberry dog bones and raspberry dice. She sent sailors purple fizzies with straws that are made of ice candy until it all thaws. Eating her candy will make you grow stronger and giraffes with short necks will even grow longer. Her Snappy-Do's will make you stay awake for hours unless you need some sleep so try the pink flowers. After a full day of sweet candy making, She lay down in her bed not long after baking.
