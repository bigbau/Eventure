Cats and Dogs and Frogs

Scat was a cat who didn't like dogs. Scat would rather sit around having lunch with frogs. Frogs were good talkers. Frogs ribbit and hum. Scat and the frogs talk all day long. Doggies were dumb. Dogs don't hop up and down like frogs. Dogs are not very good at staying on logs. Dogs can't fling their tongues and catch flies with a flick. The best dogs can do is bark and chase a stick. Frogs are green, spotted, and yellow. My friend mister Toad is a real handsome fellow. Dogs are all hairy. Dogs are practically rugs. Frogs are all slimey and gooey like slugs. Scat had to go because the moon was arising and the things that jump out at night can be a little surprising. Scat ran through the bushes and leaped through the trees. When Scat got home he had forgotten his keys. Scat bat at the door but no one was home. When suddenly Oscar the dog let Scat in. Scat scampered inside and said with a grin that dogs aren't so bad, are not really too hairy, and are good to have near when things are getting too scary. Dogs can bark nice and loud so that no one comes near while frogs only hide like a moose or a deer. Oscar agreed and said to not forget that a dog that is faithful is the best dog yet. Oscar and Scat went to the kitchen and stayed up all night talking about many things.
