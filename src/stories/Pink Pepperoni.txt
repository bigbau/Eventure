Pink Pepperoni

There once was girl named Heather who worked for her dad at the Parlor of Tony. Heather got tired of making pizza without any feeling. Heather stayed up one night and made something appealing. Heather added and stirred and she cooked and she baked. Heather used every ingredient a chef ever made. Heather was quite sure that her dad wouldn't mind. The orders came in for pizza with sausage and cheese at lunch on the next day. An order for pepperoni came through finally. Heather knows what she need to do. Heather took out her special new original treat. Heather placed it right on the top. Heather hit the bell and the order went out. Heather knew that the people would no doubt like it. Minutes went by and Heather waited with a smile. The waiter scolded Heather for her pizza with pink pepperoni. The people and her dad walked in and looked sadly at Heather. Heather asked the people to try the pizza. Everyone took a slice of the pink pepperoni made by Heather. The whole restaurant felt glad from eating the pink pepperoni. The pizza tastes like bubblegum and looks like baloney.
