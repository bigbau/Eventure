Suzie collected sea shells on the shore. She had lots of shells but she wanted some more. She rented a boat and sailed all around the isle. She collected quite many and she made a huge pile. After so long, they called her Sea Shell Suzie. She had so many shells that she even filled her jacuzzi. Suize said that sea shells are pretty as she carried them. She was happy with her shells and she'll never get married. There were pink shells and white shells and shells that were blue. There was one shell that looked a lot like a shoe. There was a trumpet type shell that made a nice tune so she blew it in the morning and the evning and at noon. But, the shellfish were sad for what Suzie did. They all got together one day and crawled back into the shells and walked back to the ocean, making sure not to wake Suzie with any loud motion. When Suzie woke up, she was surprised to find that all of the shells were gone and left her behind. But, she found the small footprints of the shellfish and said that she might take up painting instead.
