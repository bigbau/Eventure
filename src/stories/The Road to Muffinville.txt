The Road to Muffinville

We had to climb Krazy hill, jump the river of Nill, and drink from a fountain that tended to spill on the road to Muffinville. We carried star fruit in our sacks and purple canaries on our backs while running down the railroad tracks on the road to Mufinville. We swam across the lake, saw a thing we'd never seen before, and passed a giraffe that was two foot four on the road to Muffinville. On the fifthy third day of the twenty second month of the thirteenth year, We were half way there. We all sat down on the orange grass and drank cherry pifters and took a nap on the road to Muffinville. We borrowed pogo sticks from a guy named Nick. We rode in triple-file until we got sick. Then we mailed the pogos to his cousin Vick on the road to Muffinville. We climbed the ladder that looks like a chain above the cloud where they make rain. They made us climb down but we didn't complain on the road to Muffinville. We rode a goat who rode a bear who rode a car from here to there. We took a bus from the cove to the gossamer pools in which we dove. We found five-leaf clovers at pumpkin valley and clover-leaf fives in an alley. We ate rainbow colored carrots at a corner. We fed striped and dotted parrots at a shop. Finally the sign said there was one mile to go. We ran like mad and I stubbed my little toe. We finally made it to Muffinville but wouldn't you know that Muffinville for the first timeever was closed. At first we all screamed at the top of our lungs. Then we started to cry, we'd really been stung. Then we started to laugh for there was nothing else to do until the wind started in and we were glad that it blew. The wind blew away a part of the sign. We felt fine after reading it. For Muffinville will be closed next week not tonight and that made everything all right.
