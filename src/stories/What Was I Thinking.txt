What was I thinking?

What was  thinking all the way to the bus when I wore my pajamas instead of my tuxedo. We went on a field trip which was sure to be cool but I left my lunch way back at the school. What was I thinking that night in December when it was snowing outside and I didn't wear my sweater and my mom told me to be careful of the weather. I almost froze solid but I'm getting much better. What was I thinking when I went to the races I wore my shoes but forgot to wear laces. You should have seen the look on my friends faces. They looked like someone who had just gotten braces. What was I thinking when I made Sandy dinner. I used too much candy and not enough liver and the brown mashed potatoes made everyone quiver. I ended up washing the plates in the river. What was I thinking when I fed that old raccoon who liked to steal things from our garbage at noon. He smiled really nice but then chased me with a spoon. I think maybe I woke up that day an hour too soon. What was I thinking when I dyed my hair green. So green in fact that my mother made a scene and she made me take a bath so I would get clean but the hair on my head stayed green for a week or so it seemed.
