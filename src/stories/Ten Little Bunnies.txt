Ten Little Bunnies

Ten little bunnies danced in a line. They were full of pep and one missed a step so nine bunnies were left in the line. Nine little bunnies hopped through a gate. One bunny hopped too fast so eight were left. Eight little bunnies looked up in the sky and saw a bumblebee. One bunny was afraid of the bee so seven bunnies were left. Seven little bunnies carried some bricks and one bunny said that it was not easy so he left. Six bunnies were left in the line. Six bunnies went for a drive. One bunny said that there was a witch and he got caught so five bunnies were left. Five little bunnies knocked on a door of a house and a bear surprised them and got one of the bunnies so they were only four. Four little bunnies climbed up a tree. One bunny climbed to the top and saw a flying saucer. The flying saucer took one of the bunnies and three bunnies were left. Three bunnies went to the zoo. They had fun playing but did not noticed that there was a tiger so they ran and escaped. Two bunnies were left in the group. Two bunnies were eating some buns until they were full. One bunny was so full that he popped, one bunny was left. The last bunny performed a magic trick and suddenly, all ten bunnies came back.
