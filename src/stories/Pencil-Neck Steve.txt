Pencil-Neck Steve

Now would you believe that there was once was a man named Pencil-Neck Steve whose collar was even longer than his shirt sleeve. He was nearly fifteen feet taller than a Bengala Ba-Reeve. A Bengala Ba-Reeve was fifteen feet shorter than Pencil-Neck Steve. He always wore bright colors so he could be seen and people would not think he was scary or mean. But, one night he wore black when he went to the fair and it looked like his head was floating in mid air. So he found some string and tied it under his chin so it looked like a balloon with a really real grin. Everyone laughed and gave him their candy which they bought at the Candytown store from Miss Mandy. Miss Smyrtle gave Pencil-Neck Steve a new coat that had words stitched on the back that she wrote, thanking an invisible man in the city for saving her invisible kitty.
