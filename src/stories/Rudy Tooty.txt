Rudy Tooty

Once upan a time in the the land of McTooty lived a little old man three feet tall named Rudy. Rudy owned a poor donkey who was as slow as molasses and bumped into things. Rudy got the donkey some glasses. Now Rudy was happy but he wondered out loud if there was a reason he was sort of shortish and proud. Proud of the way Rudy could make certain things like shoes without buttons, or kites without strings. Rudy could take a small stick and make a small spoon. Rudy could take a big tree branch and make it a broom. Rudy could take wire and wood and make a toy train. Any left over paper would make a nice plane. But people were mean and they said Rudy was weird that he looked like an elf with a funny white beard. The children would laugh and they would gather and fidget. The children teased him whenever he made a new widget. The week before Christmas Rudy had enough joking. He filled up his fireplace and started it smoking. He got on his donkey and climbed on the rook. If Rudy was an elf then Rudy would gie them all proof. He pulled out his flute and played it. He played several songs hoping Santa would hear. Then all of a sudden, from out of the sky. He saw nine little reindeer and one jolly guy. The sleigh was all sparkly and covered with candy for when Santa was hungry it was really quite handy. He landed smoothly on the top of the house and the nine little reindeer were as quiet as a mouse. Santa asked Rudy if Rudy was ready to go. Santa said that he is one elf short and Santa wants Rudy to know that Rudy have always been special and kind. Santa said to Rudy that Rudy has helped out his neighbor and never did mind. Santa said to Rudy that Rudy is the finest of helpers. Santa was really pleased to say that Rudy is coming with him to the North Pole to stay. Now Rudy was glad.Rudy knew just what to do. Rudy hitched up his donkey with some tape and some glue.
