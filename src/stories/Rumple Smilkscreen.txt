Rumple Smilkscreen

Rumple Smilkscreen could never be seen. His feet and his hair are invisible. Everything in between in invisible. He used to walk down at the beach and make footprints in the sand. Sometimes he'd put his feet in the air and walk on his hands leaving hand prints instead of fotprints upon the land. He liked to play jokes on bullies and meanies. He'd trip them and he'd trick them and pelt them with beanies. He liked to cook dinner using mostly bun-length weenies. One day he was catching a fish with his invisible pole fisher when a really big fish jumped out of the swisher and it almost hit a lady but it barely just missed her. At last he was painting at Birkinstock out back when the paint can went falling off of the rack and Rumple became visible in orange and black. At first he tried running but he slipped and he fell. He was surrounded by one hundred or more but couldn't really tell. Some kid got excited and started to yell. The boy shouted out loud taht all should come near. The invisible man was standing right here. They came and they stared and it filled him with fear. A funny thing happened. They started to cheer. They smiled and they laughed and grinned ear to ear. For they loved Rumple Smilkscreen and made it quite clear. They gave him a hat and a coat and a key to the city. They thanked Rumple for making their town very pretty. Miss Smurtle gave him an invisible kitty.
