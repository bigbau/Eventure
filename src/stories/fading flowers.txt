Fading Flowers

On the way home from the school, they picked some beautiful yellow dandelions. She made sure to put them in water right away, so that they would not wilt too quickly. The flowers looked beautiful on the table. The flowers became a little wilted at dinnertime. Then, bedtime, the flowers were dead. She guessed that that kind of flower does not last very long. The next morning, the flowers were alive again. She said that the flowers were just sleeping. That night, she was upset because she did not have time to play before bed. Mom said that her daughter was a flower that is fading. The daughter wondered if mom was talking to her or the flower. It was so sad to see the flowers wilt. She ask herself if she looks that sad if she is upset. She got it now, she need to put on a smile to look lively as a flower but when she is grumpy, she looks like a wilting flower. She said that she should always smile forever and ever.
