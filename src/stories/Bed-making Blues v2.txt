Kay said that she does not know. Kay said that there is nothing else for her to do. Mom asked Kay if Kay can make Mom's bed while Mom makes Kay's bed. Mom asked if Kay can do breakfast dishes or the laundry for Mom, while Mom make Kay's bed? Kay said that she is thinking about it. Kay has decided that she will make her bed instead. That way Kay can practice doing it, so that she can get better and faster at it. Mom said that it sounds like a good idea. Mom said that now she can finish preparing breakfast. Mom said that they can enjoy it together, as soon as Kay are done making her bed. Kay warned the messy bed to watch out. Kay said that here she come!
