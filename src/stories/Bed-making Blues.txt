Bed-making Blues

Kay: Mom, I do not like making my bed. It takes me so long and it is too difficult. Can you make it for me, please?
Mom: Sure, but it will take away from the time that I would use to do other things for you. Which one of my jobs can you do for me, while I make your bed?
Kay: I could serve myself breakfast.
Mom: Well, that is something you already do, is it not?
Kay: Yes. Oh, then I don't know. There is nothing else for me to do.
Mom: If I make your bed, can you make my bed? Or, can you do breakfast dishes or the laundry for me, while I make your bed?
Kay: I am thinking about it. I have decided that I will make my bed instead. That way I can practice doing it, so that I can get better and faster at it.
Mom: Sounds like a good idea. Now I can finish preparing breakfast. And we can enjoy it together, as soon as you are done making your bed.
Kay: Watch our messy bed. Here I come!
